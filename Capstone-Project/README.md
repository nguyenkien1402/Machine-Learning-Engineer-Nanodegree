# Capstone Project

## Getting Started

### Overview
In this project, I will analyze the tax information from IRS from 2005 to 2015, and build a model to predict the final tax payment people will make.

### Prerequisites

These projects requires **Python 3** and the following Python modules installed:

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

You will also need to install and run [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you have not had Python installed yet, it is highly recommended to install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

If there are additional modules needed for each project, it will be explained in each README.md file.

## Running

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook XXX.ipynb
```

or 

```bash
ipython notebook XXX.ipynb
```
